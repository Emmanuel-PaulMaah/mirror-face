# üöÄ Deploy to GitHub Pages - Step-by-Step Guide

This guide will teach you how to deploy your Face Tracking Mirror app to GitHub Pages so anyone can access it online!

## Prerequisites
- A GitHub account (free at [github.com](https://github.com))
- Git installed on your computer (check by running `git --version` in terminal)

---

## Step 1: Download Your Project Files

First, download these files from Replit to your computer:

1. Click the **three dots menu** (‚ãÆ) in Replit's file explorer
2. Select **"Download as zip"**
3. Extract the zip file to a folder on your computer

**Important files to keep:**
- `index.html` - Your main app
- `demo-avatar.glb` - Demo 3D model
- `.gitignore` - Tells git which files to ignore

**Optional files:**
- `server.py` - Only for local testing (GitHub Pages doesn't need this)
- `replit.md` - Project documentation (helpful for reference)
- `DEPLOY.md` - This deployment guide

> **Note:** GitHub Pages automatically serves `index.html` - you don't need `server.py` for deployment!

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the **"+"** icon in the top-right corner

## Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå Camera doesn't work
- **HTTPS required:** GitHub Pages automatically serves over HTTPS ‚úÖ
- Clear your browser cache and try again
- Check browser permissions for camera access

### ‚ùå 404 Error / Page not found
- Wait 2-3 minutes after enabling Pages
- Make sure `index.html` is in the root folder (not in a subfolder)
- Check that the repository is **Public**

### ‚ùå 3D model doesn't load
- Make sure `demo-avatar.glb` is in the same folder as `index.html`
- Check the browser console (F12) for errors
- Verify the file was uploaded to GitHub

### ‚ùå Blank page
- Open browser console (F12) and check for errors
- Make sure all files were pushed to GitHub
- Try hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

## Advanced: Custom Domain

Want to use your own domain like `myapp.com`?

   - Enter your custom domain
   - Click **"Save"**
